          The Ethics & Corporate Compliance Institute of Nigeria (The Institute) is an independent, non-partisan, not-for-profit, Non-Governmental Organization incorporated
          in 2006 in Nigeria. The institute operates from locations in Lagos, Abuja, Enugu and Port Harcourt. The Institute was set up to meet the challenge
          of stemming corruption and moral decadence in the Nigeria public and private sectors- themselves a fall out of decades of corrupt military dictatorship
          which spread massive corruption and poverty to all facets of the Nigerian Society leading to the collapse of moral and societal values in Nigeria
        </p>
        <p>
          Nigeria has paid and continues to pay a colossal price in reputational capital for corrupt practices, both real and imagined. The Institute empowers private
          and public sector organizations to improve their governance standards; facilitates inter-sector collaboration to bolster corporate responsibility,
          public accountability, transparency, the rule of law and access to justice. In addition, the Institute serves as a resource centre, conducts
          training, workshops and research.
