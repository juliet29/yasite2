      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        In a bid to strengthen Nigeriaâ€™s anti-corruption framework, the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in July
        2016 as the 70th member country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OGP is an international multi-stakeholder initiative which was launched on 20th September 2011 to provide an international platform for domestic reformers
        to make their governments more open, accountable and responsive to citizens.

    <h3>Subnational Engagement</h3>
    <p>
      The OGP process allows for sub-national engagement under which some states in the Southeast including Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu have indicated interest
      to join and whilst advocacy is required to get the two states of Imo and Abia to also commit to open and transparent governance and to implement
      key principles of the OGP in their respective states. A key component of the OGP process is the involvement of Non State Actors/Civil Society Organizations
      as equal partners with the government in the creation, implementation and Monitoring of the Action Plans and commitments.

    <h3>Key Principles</h3>
    <div class="ogp_s3-main">
      <div>
        <h5>Transparency</h5>
        <p>
          Information on government activities and decisions is open, comprehensive, timely and freely available to the public, and meets basic open data standards.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Accountability</h5>
        <p>
          Rules, regulations, and mechanisms are in place that call upon government actors to justify their actions, act upon criticisms or requirements made of
          them and accept responsibility for failure to perform.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Citizen	Participation</h5>
        <p>
          Governments seek to mobilize citizens to engage in public debate, provide input, and make contributions that lead to more responsive and effective governance.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Technology and Innovation</h5>
        <p>
          Governments embrace the importance of new technologies in driving innovation, providing citizens with open access to technology, and increasing their capacity
          to use technology.
        </p>

    <h3>Project Rationale </h3>
    <p>
      The above three states in the South East of Nigeria having applied to join the OGP will be required to develop (along with the Non-State Actors/Civil Society
      Organizations) a State Action Plan, Commitments and Activities for implementation in close collaboration with the National OGP Secretariat for the
      first two years.
      <p>
        As such, we have identified an urgent need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Develop the capacity of the relevant Non-State Actors/Civil Society Organisations to enable them effectively participate in the identification, creation,
          implementation and monitoring of the various State Action Plans and to hold their state governments accountable for the use (or misuse) of public
          resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure the future and community ownership of the OGP process in the states by training and mainstreaming youth organisations into the OGP process.
        </li>
      </ul>
