          The Youth Accountability Forum is a platform where the youths (both male and female) are trained and mentored on how to implement the principles of Open
          Government and hold their government accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through engaging young people in accountability, there is an opportunity to connect power to youth and youth to power, redefining the relationship between
          duty bearers and young people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with young people always brings great joy, but it gives us a greater sense of satisfaction when we can empower them to get into spaces where they
          can actually interact and engage with decision-makers. We believe that youth-led accountability for the Open Government Partnership is important
          because it will allow young people to be meaningfully engaged in this new development framework.
